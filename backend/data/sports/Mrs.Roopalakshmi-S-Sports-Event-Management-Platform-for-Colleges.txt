ABSTRACT - A web application  or web app  is a computer program of the client -server in which client is run on the 
server . The client may include user interface and the client service logic. In this paper, a web application  is 
presented by developing a sports event management platform for colleges by using java, JSP, XML. The  application 
work s on the module system. There are two modules which are user and admin module. Further, the user modul e 
was divided into student and teacher modules. An android application for user module was developed i n order to 
create a user -friendly environment . This  application creates an ease atmosphere to keep up the sports event 
at colleges. The admin module consists of multiple operations where they will add the teacher who is  
answerable for the particular event, add events going down at completely different colleg es, add students 
and so on. The Teacher may add the student, view the results, the student will view results, can reg ister for 
event they’re curious about and can also post their questions. This paper provides the fortunate 
demonstration of a sports event management platform for colleges through an web app and an android app.   
 
KEYWORDS  – JSP ( Java Servlet Pages), XML ( Extensible Markup Language), client -server program.  
 
I. INTRODUCTION  
A web application consists of client server program. In earlier computing models of client –server, the process load 
for the application was shared between code  on the server and code  is put  on every  client regionally . Alternatively , 
an application had its  own  pre-compiled client  program  that  served as its   interface  and had  to be individually  put 
on every user's  personal laptop  or system . Web applications use  web documents  written  in a very normal  format 
such as  hyper text markup language  and JavaScript  that  are supported by a range  of web  browsers.  Web 
applications is thought of as a particular variant of client –server code  where the client code  is downloaded to the 
client machine once  visiting the relevant web page, using  normal  procedures such as HTTP. Through  Java , 
JavaScript  and alternative  technologies, application -specific  strategies  such as drawing on the screen, playing  an 
audio, and access to the keyboard and mouse are all attainable . Web developers typically  use client -side scripting 
to feature functionality, particularly  to make  an interactive exper tise that doesn ’t need  page reloa ding. 
Applications are normally  broken into logical chunks known as  "tiers",  where each tier is allotted to  a task . A web 
browser is the initial  tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such 
as JSP/Java ) is that the center  tier (application logic), and a database  or information  is that  the third tier 
(storage).  The web browser sends requests to the center  tier,  that  services them by creating  queries and  updates 
against the database /information  and generates a interface.  Sports are very essential in every college or 
institutions.
